# Secure_Authenticator
## Provides a way to safely store API keys locally (encrypted) but still reference the value inside of other scripts.

### Must be run with newest version of OpenSSL & Bash Version > 4.0. I suggest using homebrew to install newest Bash version if using via Mac OS.

### Usage: The -h switch when executing either of the tools (apisee or auth) will provide examples and context for their use.
