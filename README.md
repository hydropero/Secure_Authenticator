# Secure Authenticator
<br>
<br>
### This was built to provides a safe method of store API keys locally (encrypted) yet retaining the ability to reference the values held inside of other scripts. You must overwrite the existing API_DB but keep the same name for your own API Database.

### Must be run with newest version of OpenSSL & Bash Version > 4.0. I suggest using homebrew to install newest Bash version if using via Mac OS.

### Usage: The -h switch when executing either of the tools (apisee or auth) will provide examples and context for their use.
